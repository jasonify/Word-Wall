### Hours (50 mins):

[x] Setup v1 project + simple static file loading | Felt Good | Fairly Focused
[x] 30 mins -- adding post endpoint, more or less working. Learned that body-parse gotta register before routes | medium |  Lower focused 
[ ]  - Make sure to use X-www-form-urlencoded for postman instead of form-data, otherwise need .multipart() 
Maybe intead use busboy to parse multipart forms?
